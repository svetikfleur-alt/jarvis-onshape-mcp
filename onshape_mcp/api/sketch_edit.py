"""Fetch / merge / post plumbing for `edit_sketch`.

Iteration on a sketch — addEntities, addConstraints, removeIds — without
having to rebuild and re-POST the whole feature from scratch. The flow:

    1. GET /features and find the BTMSketch-151 by featureId.
    2. Read its `feature.entities` and `feature.constraints` lists.
    3. Validate addEntity/addConstraint ids don't collide with existing ids.
    4. Cascade-remove: any constraint that references an entity in
       `removeIds` (directly or via `entityId.subpoint` form like
       `line1.start`) gets dropped too — surfaced in `cascaded_removals`
       so callers see exactly what got pulled.
    5. Splice the lists (remove + append) and POST the whole feature
       back via apply_feature_and_check(operation="update").

What this module does NOT do: serialize user-facing entity/constraint
dicts into BTM* wire shape. That's the constraint-first surface lead
(cz3cmn1y) is building separately. This scaffolding passes
addEntities/addConstraints THROUGH unchanged so when the serializer
lands on the same branch it just wires into `wire_entity_id` /
`wire_constraint_refs` below and everything else flows.
